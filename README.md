## dependencies

There are two dependencies that you need before you can fiddle with pixels and characters and junk: [jp2a][jp2a] and [ImageMagick][imagemagick]. `jp2a` handles conversion of a JPEG to ASCII, and ImageMagick can do everything from image conversion to probably running a nuclear reactor.

### os x

If you're using [Homebrew][brew], blindly run this:

    brew install jp2a imagemagick

[jp2a]:        https://csl.name/jp2a/
[imagemagick]: http://www.imagemagick.org
[brew]:        http://brew.sh
