## what's insideâ„¢

Important business programmers don't have time to switch away from their terminal to view the diff of an image they're about to commit. The three seconds it takes to open an external diff visualization program could drive your sales team to drink and make inappropriate remarks to your new employees. Increase your productivity bottom line today, with `spaceman-diff`!

`spaceman-diff` is a quick drop in to `git-diff`. The idea is that you can just `git diff` like normal and, if you've changed an image file, `spaceman-diff` will render your images in a colorful ASCII approximation in your shell along with helpful data like file size changes.

Here's a quick example of what you might see:

~SCREENSHOT~

The goal is that `spaceman-diff` gives you a quick way of verifying that yes, the image you're committing is the image you want to commit, and yes, the image you're committing isn't 20 terabytes in size or something foolish like that.

## dependencies

There are two dependencies that you need before you can fiddle with pixels and characters and junk: [jp2a][jp2a] and [ImageMagick][imagemagick]. `jp2a` handles conversion of a JPEG to ASCII, and ImageMagick can do everything from image conversion to probably running a nuclear reactor.

### os x

If you're using [Homebrew][brew], blindly run this:

    brew install jp2a imagemagick

## install

Once you have your dependencies installed, drop `spaceman-diff` (LINK NEEDED) onto your system or your dotfiles directory or whatever kooky stuff you're using. After that, you need to configure Git to use `spaceman-diff` for all your diffs.

In your `~/.gitconfig`, you'll want to add a snippet of code so it looks like this:

```txt
[diff]
        external = path/to/spaceman-diff
```

This line tells Git that you want to use `spaceman-diff` for all of your diffs. In `spaceman-diff` we make a quick check to see if the file passed to it is an image (jpg/png/gif, etc), and if not, we pass it back to Git with `git diff --no-ext-diff`. Basically, if we're supposed to be rendering an image diff we do it, otherwise we bounce it back to Git's internal diffing.

Note: this is kind of a naive approach, and it probably won't work very well if you *already* use an external diff tool for diffs. There's a couple other options here for you that you can look into: Git attributes to determine which filetype specifically to shoot to `spaceman-diff`, or tie it into `git difftool`. (By the way: if you run into this problem yourself, shoot over a pull request with your docs and it'd be lovely to add it to this `README` for others to use.)

Alternatively, `spaceman-diff` is just a really simple and dumb shell script, so if there's anything in here that doesn't quite work for you, just make the changes in your own `spaceman-diff` file. No one will tell on you.
